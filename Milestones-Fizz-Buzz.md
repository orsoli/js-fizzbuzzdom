### MILESTONE 1

Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100 to the console, but:

- for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
- for multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
- for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

### MILESTONE 2

Create an element that acts as a container in the DOM and then fill it with elements via JS.

We can use various techniques (template literals, innerHTML, append, etc.).

### MILESTONE 3

Apply different styles to the elements added to the DOM in bonus 1, depending on whether the inserted value is a number, a fizz, a buzz, or a fizzbuzz.

As we have seen, various techniques can be used (style, className, classList).

If you are short of ideas for styling, you could take inspiration from the screenshot provided in the assignment.
